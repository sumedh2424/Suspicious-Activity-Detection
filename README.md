## Introduction

Suspicious human activity recognition from surveillance video is an active research area in image processing and computer vision. This project aims to develop a novel machine learning-based approach for real-time suspicious activity detection in CCTV footage. The system monitors sensitive and public areas such as bus stations, railway stations, airports, banks, shopping malls, schools, colleges, parking lots, and roads to prevent terrorism, theft, accidents, illegal parking, vandalism, fighting, chain snatching, and other criminal activities.

## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: The system continuously monitors CCTV footage in real-time.
- **Activity Classification**: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to categorize human activities as usual and unusual.
- **Alert Generation**: Automatically generates alerts for suspicious activities detected.
- **Customizable Frontend**: The frontend of the project is implemented using Tkinter for easy customization and user interaction.
- **Efficient Backend**: Python is used for the backend implementation, ensuring efficient processing of surveillance footage.
- **Deep Learning Algorithm**: CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) is employed for accurate activity recognition and detection.

## Abstract

Suspicious human activity recognition from surveillance video is crucial for preventing terrorism, theft, accidents, and other criminal activities in public places. This project proposes a novel machine learning-based approach for real-time suspicious activity detection in CCTV footage. By utilizing advanced algorithms and techniques in image processing and computer vision, the system can accurately monitor and categorize human activities. Recent advancements in visual surveillance have paved the way for more effective detection of abnormal activities, and this project contributes to this ongoing research area.

## Usage

1. Launch the application.
2. Select the CCTV footage source.
3. The system will start monitoring and detecting suspicious activities in real-time.
4. Alerts will be generated for any detected suspicious activities.
5. Users can customize the system settings and parameters as needed.
